# vision-based-object-counting-system

## Description
The aim of the proposed object counting system is to create a framework where various object detection models can be trained and configured easily which is then deployed for an
object counting application. The framework is constructed with three online platforms namely Streamlit web application, Telegram and Node-RED. A Streamlit web application is built
for users to train and evaluate custom object detection models which will be deployed into TensorFlow server to save cost. Next, Telegram allows users to upload image data, obtain
count value, and provide feedback to correct the count accuracy of models, and finally, Node-RED for incoming data management and model performance visualization.
